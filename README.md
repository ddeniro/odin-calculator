# Odin Project Calculator
This was a fantastic learning experience about building a front-end interactive calculator with keyboard support.

Particular challenges I faced were creating the button layout, which got me good practice with CSS grid.

I also struggled with the logic behind the calculator, trying various approached unsuccessfully before realizing I could use infix to postfix evaluation which I learned in my Data Structures and Algorithms college course. 

Were I ever to revisit this project, I will make it more responsive and add some more functions onto the calculator.
